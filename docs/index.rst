Welcome to scholia's documentation!
===================================

Scholia is a tool to handle scientific bibliographic information through Wikidata.
The Scholia Web service creates on-the-fly scholarly profiles for researchers,
organizations, journals, publishers, individual scholarly works, and for research
topics. To collect the data, it queries the SPARQL-based Wikidata Query Service.
Among several display formats available in Scholia are lists of publications for
individual researchers and organizations, publications per year, employment
timelines, as well as coauthor and topic networks and citation graphs.
The Python package implementing the Web service is also able to format Wikidata
bibliographic entries for use in LaTeX/BIBTeX.
